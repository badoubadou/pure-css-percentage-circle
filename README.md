# Getting Started With Gulp

Description:

A pure CSS progress bar that shows progress bar with percentage in a circular bar view, inspired by André Firchow. I translated to stylus, added some animation and used data atribute for the percentage.

How to use it:
	Load the cpbs.css in the document’s head section.

Had the html and set the data atribute "p" to your wanted percentage
```html
	<div class="c100" data-p="70">
		<div class="slice">
			<div class="second_half"></div>
			<div class="warp_first_half">
				<div class="first_half"></div>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
```
